				<p class="gallerytext">The best mistake I made was while going to Le Pharee Amedee; a beautiful, though touristy, marine reserve island. I was told to wait where some other people were waiting, and shortly they started heading towards a boat. Red flag one, it’s still about 20 minutes too early, red flag two, the boat is too small for such a touristy thing, red flag three, when half way through asking if it was the boat for the island, the lady said “plongee” or in English, diving. But I knew it was going to the correct island so I got on, and am so glad I did. While my tourist comrades had a much smoother and drier trip, I arrived before they did, enabling me to snap some pictures before most of the fish were scared away or the beaches were polluted by overly tanned, arrogant Australians (that opinion may have been influenced by one of my beach neighbours…) A++, will ‘mistake’ again.</p>
